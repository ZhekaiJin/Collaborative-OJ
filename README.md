# Collaborative-OJ
This is a project to implement a web-based collaborative code editor which supports multiple users editing simultaneously. I designed a single-page web application for coding, running, and compiling problems. To refactored and improved system throughput, I used decoupling services based on RESTful API and loaded balancing by Nginx.
